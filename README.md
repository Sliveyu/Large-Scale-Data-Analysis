# Power BI Superstore Dashboard – Sales, Profitability, Customer, and Product Analytics

## Overview - Project Purpose

The goal of this project is to showcase core **data analysis**, **visualisation**, and **dashboarding skills** using the Superstore dataset. This is an interactive dashboard-style report optimised for desktop monitors, stakeholder presentations, and business intelligence workflows. The report is designed for business stakeholders who need fast, actionable insights into **sales performance**, **profitability**, **customer behavior**, and **product trends**.

My analysis answers key questions like:
- Where and when is the business making the most profit?
- Which customer segments and regions are driving sales?
- What products are underperforming despite high sales?
- How does seasonality affect orders and margins?

This is a résumé-focused project for demonstrating my ability to:
- Design interactive dashboards in **Power BI**
- Translate raw data into insights
- Use DAX, slicers, and calculated columns for dynamic reporting
- Structure data stories for executive and operational audiences
